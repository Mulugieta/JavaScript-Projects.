JavaScript Projects
A collection of various JavaScript projects showcasing different functionalities and applications. This repository serves as a showcase of my work and learning journey in JavaScript development.

üöÄ Project Goal & Purpose
This repository is designed to be a collection of fundamental JavaScript projects, each illustrating a key concept or application. It aims to demonstrate practical implementations of JavaScript for web development.

‚ú® Key Features
This repository includes a variety of projects. Here are the projects available so far:

Project 1: Basic AJAX Demo

Description: This project demonstrates the fundamental concept of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) using the XMLHttpRequest object. It allows for dynamically updating a web page's content without requiring a full page reload by fetching data from a separate HTML file.
Features:
Dynamically loads content into a specific section of the page.
Uses a simple button click to trigger content fetching.
Illustrates the XMLHttpRequest lifecycle (opening, ready state changes, sending requests).
Project 2: Automatic Image Slideshow

Description: This project implements an automatic image slideshow, cycling through a series of images with captions at a set interval. It showcases basic DOM manipulation and timed events in JavaScript.
Features:
Automatically transitions between images.
Displays image captions.
Simple and clean design.
Project 3: jQuery Dynamic Challenge

Description: This project explores the capabilities of the jQuery library, focusing on dynamic content manipulation, event handling, and built-in animation effects. It demonstrates how to add elements to the DOM, respond to user interactions, and apply visual transitions efficiently.
Features:
Dynamically creates and appends HTML elements to the page.
Demonstrates basic event handling (e.g., click event) with jQuery.
Illustrates jQuery's slideUp() and slideDown() effects for animated content visibility.
Changes element content and styling based on user interaction.
Project 4: Pizza Order Drill Demo

Description: This project simulates a simple pizza ordering system. Users can select pizza sizes, various toppings, and view a calculated price. It includes form validation and features a contact form with custom alert modals.
Features:
Interactive pizza size and topping selection.
Dynamic calculation of total order price based on selections.
Form validation for required fields (phone number, pizza size).
Custom modal pop-ups for alerts and contact form.
User-friendly interface for placing orders.
Project 5: Introductory React Concepts

Description: This section of the repository provides foundational examples demonstrating key concepts of the React library, including component creation, managing component state, and using JSX for declarative UI development.
Features:
React_1.html (Basic Counter): A simple React component that displays the time elapsed since the page loaded, showcasing basic component rendering and updates.
React_2.html (Like Button): A "Like" button component that changes its text upon being clicked, illustrating state management within a React class component.
React_3.html (JSX Greeting): A "Hello, World!" example demonstrating the use of JSX syntax for defining React components, compiled directly in the browser using Babel.
Project 6: Tic Tac Toe Game

Description: A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows two players (or one player against a simulated computer opponent) to play the traditional tic-tac-toe game. The game includes win condition checks, visual feedback for winning lines, and audio cues.
Features:
Interactive game board where players can mark 'X' or 'O'.
Logic to detect winning combinations.
Visual animation for winning lines drawn on a canvas.
Sound effects for placing marks.
Resets the game board after a win or tie.
Project 7: Simple ToDo List Application

Description: A basic ToDo list application that allows users to add and remove tasks. It leverages browser's local storage to persist the tasks, meaning your list remains even after closing and reopening the browser.
Features:
Add new tasks to a list.
Remove tasks from the list.
Tasks are saved and retrieved using local storage, providing persistence.
Clean and responsive user interface.
Project 8: Simple Calculator Application

Description: A functional calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and displays results on a digital screen.
Features:
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear function to reset the calculator.
Responsive design for various screen sizes.
Visual feedback on button presses.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
The projects in this repository primarily use:

JavaScript: Core programming language for functionality.
HTML5: For structuring the web content.
CSS3: For styling and visual presentation.
jQuery: Used in Project 3 for DOM manipulation and effects.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, demonstrated in Project 5 for component-based development.
Babel: Used in Project 5 (React_3.html) for on-the-fly JSX compilation.
HTML Canvas API: Used in Project 6 for drawing dynamic win lines.
Web Storage API (localStorage): Used in Project 7 for data persistence.
